# SubMIC_Carvacrol

**SubMIC_Carvacrol:** A predictive microbiology model to determine the effect of **Sub**inhibitory concentrations (working under the **M**inimal **I**nhibitory **C**oncentration) of **Carvacrol** on the foodborne bacterial species *Escherichia coli* and *Bacillus cereus*.

The code in the repository provides experimental data and model-based simulations for the inactivation dynamics of *E. coli* and *B. cereus* viable counts (CFUs/mL) under different subinhibitory concentrations of **Carvarol** (mg/mL) during a time lapse of 48 hours. The mathematical model that explains the data can be found in (), while the parameters estimation to fit the model was peformed using the **MATLAB** toolbox **AMIGO2**, freely available at: https://sites.google.com/site/amigo2toolbox 

Two codes are provided in the repository: the one titled *Carvacrol_Inhibition_of_Ecoli_Bcereus-Model&Data.m*, to be run in the commercial computing software **Matlab**, and other named *Carvacrol_Inhibition_of_Ecoli_Bcereus-Model&Data.m*, to be run in the free software for statistical computing **R**.
