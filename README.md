# SubMIC_Carvacrol

*SubMIC_Carvacrol*: A predictive microbiology model to determine the effect of **Sub**inhibitory concentrations (working under the **M**inimal **I**nhibitory **C**oncentration) of **Carvacrol** on the foodborne bacterial species *Escherichia coli* and *Bacillus cereus*.

The code included in the repository provides experimental data and model-based simulations of the inactivation dynamics for *E. coli* and *B. cereus* viable counts (CFUs/mL) under different concentrations of **Carvarol** (mg/mL) during a time lapse of 48 hours. The mathematical model to explain the data can be found in (enlace al paper), while the parameters estimation to fit the model was peformed using the **MATLAB** toolbox **AMIGO2**, available at https://sites.google.com/site/amigo2toolbox 

Two codes are provided: *Carvacrol_Inhibition_of_Ecoli_Bcereus-Model&Data.m* to be run in the commercial software **Matlab**, and *Carvacrol_Inhibition_of_Ecoli_Bcereus-Model&Data.m* to be run in the free software for statistical computing **R**
